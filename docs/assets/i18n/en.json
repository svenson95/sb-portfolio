If, for example, only 3 shots were taken on the opponent's goal in the whole game and the game was only won 1-0, the performance was mediocre. In other live score applications, only the \"result form\" is displayed, derived from the outcome of the respective game. The data for this is loaded from the RapidAPI <a target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football\">API-FOOTBALL</a>, for this I have created an additional application to load new data and save it in my MongoDB database.
